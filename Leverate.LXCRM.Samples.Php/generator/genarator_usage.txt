Generating soap proxy classes:
1. Create instance of SoapProxyGenerator
	First param points to webservice WSDL
	Second param contains options for php SoapClient - may by skipped

2. Set serviceAlias for code generation
	serviceALias will be used as a name of generated proxy class 
	(default if not set is service)

3. Set typePrefix for code generation
	typePrefix will be used to prefixing sopa types name in generated types classess
	(default if not set is empty string)
	
4. Set outputFile if you need generated code to be saved to file
	You should specify valid file path
	
	If this filed is not set, result will not be saved instead of
	it will be displayed on the screen.
	
5. Run generateCode method for code generating.

6. If your ws contains types witch are derived from other types
you can try to use EXPERIMENTAL switch to generete proper class tree structure.
To do this set the $tryFindBase property to true on SoapProxyGenerator object.

In the example I've used open service on address

I cant assure that above WS is working. I used this only for example purposes.
